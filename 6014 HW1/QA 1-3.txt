1. 11.0+10+2.8+3.0+5.5/5=6.46ms,
We know that the average TB-TA time of a 500-byte packet is (10 + 2.8 + 2.4 + 4 + 5.5) / 5 = 4.94 ms, while the average TB-TA time of a 1000-byte packet is (11.0 + 10 + 2.8 + 3.0 + 5.5)/5 = 6.46 ms. So the transmission delay of a 600-byte packet should be about 1.2 times the delay of a 500-byte packet (because 600/500 = 1.2), which will be slightly lower than 0.6 times the delay of a 1000-byte packet (because 600/1000 = 0.6 ). So we can estimate that the transmission delay of a 600-byte packet is approximately: 4.94. 4.94×1.2+6.46×0.6/2=4.902ms. A reasonable estimate of the transmission and propagation delays that a 600-byte packet will experience is 4.902ms

2.Network congestion: If a specific router or link experiences higher traffic, it may cause increased packet latency. Network congestion is usually due to large data transfers or many users using network resources simultaneously.
Router processing speed: Sometimes, routers process packets slowly, possibly due to hardware limitations or other processes running on the router. Router performance issues or temporary technical glitches may also cause increased latency.
